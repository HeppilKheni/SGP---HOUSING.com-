            <p>With new buildings mushrooming everywhere, there is a huge demand for new flats. And yet, most people opt for a resale home. However, taking a call on whether to invest in a new flat or a resale one may be difficult.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Typically, new or primary homes are the ones which are acquired directly from developers, and a resale or secondary homes are the properties that have had a previous owner. </p>
            <br>
            <p>Below are the key factors that may help you take an informed decision:</p>
            <br>
            <div class="info1_blur">
                <p>is the most important factor while buying a home.  Most of the property seekers want to buy a resale flat in anticipation of paying a lesser amount. However, there are various other costs associated with resale (registration fee, transfer fee, stamp charges, utility charges, etc.). Moreover, resale flats may require repair and maintenance.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Also, primary homes that are constructed in upcoming locations or suburbs will cost you lesser when compared to resale homes in established localities of a city.
                When you invest in a new property, you have an option under which you have to pay only 20-30 per cent of the total amount upfront. You get ample time to pay the remaining amount over three to four years while the construction is on. Developers of a new property in India also come up with several attractive payment schemes and discounted offers to choose from, making this a feasible option for home buyers.</p>
                <br>
                <p>A brand new home comes with newer fixtures and fittings which can guarantee problem-free performance for a longer period, while older fittings are a common issue in resale flats. Also, new projects by reputed developers are more space-optimised, energy-efficient and are equipped with all modern facilities. </p>
                <br>
                <p>While buying a primary house, you have a plenty of options to choose from, ranging from number of bedrooms, size of the flat, floor and fittings plans to view of the flat, etc.  In a resale flat, these options may not be available. </p>
                <br>
                <p>The process involved in buying a resale property is a long one which includes a background check of the seller, title check and verification of documents, closure of home loan by seller, registration of property in authority etc. When you buy a new home, your developer takes care of the whole process. </p>
